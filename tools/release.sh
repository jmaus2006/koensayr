# release.sh — bump apply.bash's # Version: header, fold [Unreleased]
# into a fresh CHANGELOG section, commit, tag, and (with --push) push.
# Validates preconditions up front; exits non-zero on failure without
# partial-applying.

Usage: ./tools/release.sh <semver> [--push]

Release helper. Bumps apply.bash's # Version: header, renames
[Unreleased] in CHANGELOG.md to [<version>] - YYYY-MM-DD, commits both,
and creates an annotated v<version> tag at HEAD.

A new empty [Unreleased] section is NOT prepended; add one when the
next batch of changes actually lands.

Refuses to proceed unless: <semver> is strict X.Y.Z (no v prefix,
no pre-release / build metadata), the working tree is clean,
no tag named v<semver> already exists, and [Unreleased] has at least
one bulleted entry.

After printing a summary, sleeps 3 seconds before mutating anything
(Ctrl-C to abort during that window).

Examples:
    ./tools/release.sh 2.0.0          # commits + tags locally
    ./tools/release.sh 2.0.0 --push   # also pushes current branch + tag

Without --push, prints the manual push commands at the end.
