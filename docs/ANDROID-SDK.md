# Android SDK setup

The Android SDK is required only for the `--avrcp` flag, which builds `src/Y1Bridge/` via Gradle. Gradle itself is bootstrapped by the in-tree wrapper (`src/Y1Bridge/gradlew`) — no separate Gradle install needed — but the wrapper still needs the SDK to compile against and locate `aapt` / `d8` / etc.

This project (apply.bash flash flow) is **Linux-only**, so all instructions below target Linux. There is **no Linux distribution package for the Android SDK** (Google's licensing prevents redistribution, so it's not in DNF / APT / EPEL / RPMFusion). Everything below ends up at the same end state: an SDK directory containing `cmdline-tools/`, `platform-tools/`, `platforms/android-34/`, and `build-tools/34.0.0/`, with `ANDROID_HOME` pointing at it (or `sdk.dir` set in `src/Y1Bridge/local.properties`).

## Easy path: `tools/install-android-sdk.sh`

The repo provides an idempotent installer that downloads and provisions everything:

```bash
./tools/install-android-sdk.sh
```

It will:

1. Detect an existing SDK at `$ANDROID_HOME` or `tools/android-sdk/` — if either is usable (has `platforms/android-34/`), reuse it without re-downloading.
2. Otherwise: download Google's `commandlinetools-linux-XXXXXXX_latest.zip` (pinned build) into `tools/android-sdk/cmdline-tools/latest/`, accept licenses (`yes | sdkmanager --licenses` — running this script is your acceptance, see the script header), install `platforms;android-34` + `build-tools;34.0.0` + `platform-tools`.
3. **Always** (re-runnable / heals partial-state from prior runs):
   - Write `sdk.dir=<path>` into `src/Y1Bridge/local.properties` so Gradle finds the SDK without `ANDROID_HOME` in your shell.
   - Write `tools/android-sdk-env.sh` (sourceable). Contains `export ANDROID_HOME=…; export PATH=…:cmdline-tools/latest/bin:platform-tools`. Source it (`source tools/android-sdk-env.sh`) when you want `adb` / `sdkmanager` on PATH for interactive shell use. Gradle doesn't need this — it reads `local.properties` directly.

Disk: ~1.5–2 GB. Network: ~1.7 GB total. JDK 17+ is a prereq (the script bails early with install instructions if it's missing).

The two outputs serve different consumers:

| File | Read by | Required for |
|---|---|---|
| `src/Y1Bridge/local.properties` | Gradle (build time) | `./gradlew assembleDebug` |
| `tools/android-sdk-env.sh` | Your interactive shell (after `source …`) | `adb shell …`, `sdkmanager --list_installed`, etc. |

If you want `ANDROID_HOME` persisted across shells, append the contents of `tools/android-sdk-env.sh` to your `~/.bashrc` / `~/.zshrc`.

Bumping the pinned cmdline-tools build: edit `CMDLINE_TOOLS_BUILD` at the top of `tools/install-android-sdk.sh`, `rm -rf tools/android-sdk/`, re-run.

Everything below is the **manual fallback**: how to install the SDK by hand if the script doesn't fit your situation (existing system-wide install you'd rather configure, supply-chain policy that doesn't allow scripted downloads, etc.).

## Components needed for this project

| Component | Why |
|---|---|
| `platforms;android-34` | `compileSdk 34` in `src/Y1Bridge/app/build.gradle` |
| `build-tools;34.0.0` | AGP 9.2.0 invokes `aapt2`, `d8`, `zipalign` from this version |
| `platform-tools` | `adb` for device interaction. Optional for *building*, mandatory for the post-flash verification steps. |

Total fresh install (cmdline-tools + the three components above): **~1.5–2 GB** before Gradle pulls its own dependency cache (another ~500 MB on first `./gradlew assembleDebug`).

## Already have it?

Skip ahead if these already work:

```bash
echo "$ANDROID_HOME"                                 # should print a path
ls "$ANDROID_HOME/platforms/android-34"              # should list non-empty
ls "$ANDROID_HOME/build-tools/34.0.0"                # should list non-empty
"$ANDROID_HOME/cmdline-tools/latest/bin/sdkmanager" --version    # should print a version
```

If `ANDROID_HOME` is unset but Android Studio is installed, the SDK is typically at `~/Android/Sdk` — set `ANDROID_HOME` to that path and you're done.

## Manual install (Rocky / Alma / RHEL / Fedora / Debian / Ubuntu / Arch)

Same steps regardless of distro — the cmdline-tools are platform-agnostic Java + scripts, distributed only by Google.

```bash
# 1. Download the standalone cmdline-tools (~150 MB).
#    Browse https://developer.android.com/studio#command-tools and grab the
#    "Command line tools only" Linux zip.
mkdir -p ~/Android/Sdk/cmdline-tools
cd ~/Android/Sdk/cmdline-tools
unzip ~/Downloads/commandlinetools-linux-*_latest.zip

# 2. Move into the canonical layout. sdkmanager expects to live at
#    cmdline-tools/latest/bin/sdkmanager, NOT cmdline-tools/cmdline-tools/...
mv cmdline-tools latest

# 3. Install the components. Accept licenses when prompted (or run
#    `yes | ~/Android/Sdk/cmdline-tools/latest/bin/sdkmanager --licenses`).
~/Android/Sdk/cmdline-tools/latest/bin/sdkmanager \
    --install "platforms;android-34" "build-tools;34.0.0" "platform-tools"

# 4. Persist ANDROID_HOME (bash; for zsh use ~/.zshrc, fish use ~/.config/fish/config.fish).
cat >> ~/.bashrc <<'EOF'
export ANDROID_HOME=$HOME/Android/Sdk
export PATH=$PATH:$ANDROID_HOME/cmdline-tools/latest/bin:$ANDROID_HOME/platform-tools
EOF
source ~/.bashrc
```

## JDK requirement

**Gradle (this doc's setup): JDK 17 minimum.** Confirmed working: JDK 17, 21, and 25 with the in-tree AGP 9.2.0 + Gradle 9.5.0.

**`patch_y1_apk.py` (invoked under `--music-apk`, and by extension `--all`): JDK 11–21 only.** apktool 2.9.3's bundled smali assembler silently drops patches on Java 22+, so the patcher warns on a newer JDK and its DEX-signature check will fail. If you only have JDK 22+ installed, install a 17 or 21 alongside it and point `JAVA_HOME` at the older one before running `--music-apk`.

Install whatever you prefer (within the appropriate range):

- Rocky / Alma / RHEL / Fedora: `sudo dnf install -y java-17-openjdk-devel` (or `java-21-openjdk-devel`)
- Debian / Ubuntu: `sudo apt install -y openjdk-17-jdk` (or `openjdk-21-jdk`)
- Arch: `sudo pacman -S jdk17-openjdk` (or `jdk21-openjdk`)

**The `-devel` (Rocky/Fedora) / `-jdk` (Debian) package suffix matters** — the plain `java-N-openjdk` / `openjdk-N-jre` packages ship the JRE only, no `javac`. Gradle reports `Toolchain ... does not provide the required capabilities: [JAVA_COMPILER]` if you only have the JRE. Install the dev/JDK variant.

```bash
# Adjust path per distro; example for Rocky/Fedora with JDK 25:
export JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java-25-openjdk
$JAVA_HOME/bin/javac -version    # verify: javac 25.x.x

# Persist for new shells:
echo 'export JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java-25-openjdk' >> ~/.bashrc
```

**Gotcha — gradle daemon caching:** Gradle keeps its build daemon alive across invocations. If you change `JAVA_HOME` (or upgrade the underlying JDK install) after a build has run, the cached daemon keeps the *old* JVM. You'll get the same `[JAVA_COMPILER]` error even though the new `JAVA_HOME` is fine. Stop the daemon before rebuilding:

```bash
( cd src/Y1Bridge && ./gradlew --stop && ./gradlew assembleDebug )
```

`./gradlew --version` shows the current daemon JVM under `Daemon JVM:`; if that doesn't match your `JAVA_HOME`, run `--stop`.

## Verify the install

After the steps above, in a fresh shell:

```bash
echo $ANDROID_HOME                                       # → your SDK path
sdkmanager --list_installed                              # → lists platforms;android-34, build-tools;34.0.0, platform-tools
java -version                                            # → 17 or newer
( cd src/Y1Bridge && ./gradlew --version )          # → Gradle 9.5.0, JVM 17+
```

If those four pass, `./apply.bash --avrcp` will resolve the SDK and Gradle correctly (with `rom.zip` staged in `staging/` or pointed at via `--artifacts-dir <path>`).

## License acceptance

`sdkmanager --install …` will prompt to accept Google's licenses on first run. To accept up-front (e.g. in a script), use:

```bash
yes | sdkmanager --licenses
```

The licenses live at `$ANDROID_HOME/licenses/` after acceptance — back them up if you want to short-circuit license re-acceptance on a fresh machine.

## Bumping the SDK pins

If the project bumps `compileSdk` or AGP:

1. Update the corresponding pin in `src/Y1Bridge/app/build.gradle` (`compileSdk`).
2. Re-run `sdkmanager --install "platforms;android-XX" "build-tools;XX.Y.Z"`.
3. Update the **Components needed** table at the top of this file.
